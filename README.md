# MyReads Project

I built this project locally. It implements a simple BookList app, according to the project requirements. Users can search for books to add to their bookshelf and move books between shelves (Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read) in their app. The app dynamically updates to reflects changes to shelves and submits requests to backend to update the data there. 


## To run project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
